# #deleteTinder

I deleted Tinder and started picking up girls only face-to-face. It changed my life. And I believe it might change yours. 

## Why

Sometimes you see a nice girl in the metro. But it's almost always very noisy, both in stations and in trains. If you're in a car with a girl you like, it might be hard to strike up a conversation when the car is overcrowded. So, for me, it's not really comfortable to pick up girls in these situations.  

There were absolutely no reasons why the idea came to my mind. I didn't even think about that :) But that's just how it is and I created this app.  

Now, if I want to pick up a girl in the metro, I just give her my phone with this site I've just created. I'll be experimenting, collecting stats, and making changes for better results. So, if anyone else finds this useful, feel free to use it :) And good luck!


### How to

* How to open your stats? Tap screen 15 times or click mouse 15 times. Then you'll be able to see your data and can delete it.
